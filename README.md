## Introduction to React
React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. 
It enables developers to build reusable UI components and efficiently update the DOM by using a virtual DOM for optimal performance.


## Start a New React Project

If you want to create a new app or website entirely with React, I suggest choosing one of the React-powered frameworks that are popular in the community.

You can use React without a framework, but we have found that most apps and sites eventually need to address common issues like code splitting, routing, data fetching, and HTML generation. These challenges are not unique to React but are common to all UI libraries.

By starting with a framework, you can quickly get up and running with React and avoid the need to develop your own framework later.

## Next js 

[Next.js’ Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/) is a full-stack React framework. It’s versatile and lets you create React apps of any size—from a mostly static blog to a complex dynamic application. To create a new Next.js project, run in your terminal:

```
npx create-next-app@latest

```

Next.js is maintained by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). You can [deploy a Next.js app](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) to any Node.js or serverless hosting, or to your own server. Next.js also supports a [static export](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) which doesn’t require a server.


## Next js App Router

[O *App Router* do Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) is a redesign of the Next.js APIs aiming to fulfill the React team’s full-stack architecture vision. It lets you fetch data in asynchronous components that run on the server or even during the build.

Next.js is maintained by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). You can [deploy a Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) app to any Node.js or serverless hosting, or to your own server. Next.js also supports [static export](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) which doesn’t require a server.

## Vite

Overview
Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:

A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

Vite is opinionated and comes with sensible defaults out of the box. Read about what's possible in the Features Guide. Support for frameworks or integration with other tools is possible through Plugins. The Config Section explains how to adapt Vite to your project if needed.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. If you don’t have it yet, you can download it from the official Node.js website, it’s really simple.
- Step 1: Create a new Vite project
To create a new Vite project, open your terminal and run the following command:

```
npx create-vite your-project-name --template react
```

 Replace your-project-name with the name you want for your project. Vite supports many frameworks, but in this case, we specify the react template with the --template react option.
- Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
Once the Vite project is created, navigate to the project directory:

```
cd your-project-name
```
Don’t forget to replace your-project-name with the actual name you chose for your project (unless of course, you want to keep this name for your project).

- Step 3: Install dependencies and run the development server
Next, install the necessary dependencies and start the development server:
```
npm 
npm run dev
```

After running these commands, you should see a message in your terminal indicating that your React website is running on a specific port, it’s usually a ‘random’ port number like http://localhost:5173.
Now, open your browser and visit the provided URL to see your React website in action.

## React Developer Tools
Use React Developer Tools to inspect React components, edit props and state, and identify performance problems.

Browser extension 
The easiest way to debug websites built with React is to install the React Developer Tools browser extension. It is available for several popular browsers:

- [Install for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
- [Install for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)
- [Install for Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/react-developer-tools/gpphkfbcpidddadnkolkpfckpihlkkil)

### Safari and other browsers 
For other browsers (for example, Safari), install the react-devtools npm package:
```
# Yarn
yarn global add react-devtools
```
```
# Npm
npm install -g react-devtools
```
Next open the developer tools from the terminal:
```
react-devtools
```

Then connect your website by adding the following <script> tag to the beginning of your website’s <head>:
```
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="http://localhost:8097"></script>
```

## JSX
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. It allows developers to write HTML elements and components in a more concise and readable manner within JavaScript files.

```// src/App.js
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Functional Components
Functional components are simple functions that accept props as an argument and return JSX elements. With React Hooks, functional components can also have state and side effects.
```
import React from 'react';

const FunctionalComponent = () => {
  return <p>This is a functional component.</p>;
}

export default FunctionalComponent;
```

## Class Components
Class components are ES6 classes that extend the React Component.
They can maintain and manage local state and have access to lifecycle methods, making them more feature-rich than functional components.

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class ClassComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return <p>This is a class component.</p>;
  }
}

export default ClassComponent;
```

## Props
Props are a way of passing data from a parent component to a child component in React. They are immutable and provide a way of making components dynamic and reusable.
```
import React from 'react';

const PropsExample = (props) => {
  return <p>{props.message}</p>;
}

export default PropsExample;

```

## State
 State React represents the changing state of a component. This allows components to manage and update their own data, resulting in dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
 ```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class StateExample extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Increment
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default StateExample;

 ```


## Lifecycle Methods
Lifecycle methods are special methods in class components that are invoked at different phases of a component's lifecycle componentDidMoun is a commonly used lifecycle method, executed after a component has been rendered in the DOM.
```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class LifecycleExample extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log('Component is mounted!');
  }

  render() {
    return <p>Lifecycle Example</p>;
  }
}

export default LifecycleExample;
```




## Events Handling
React uses camelCase to handle events. Functions can be defined to handle events such as clicks, changes, etc., providing interactivity to the components.
```
import React from 'react';

const EventHandlingExample = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    alert('Button clicked!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}

export default EventHandlingExample;

```

##  React Hooks

React Hooks are functions that allow functional components to manage state and side effects.
They were introduced in React 16.8 and provide a more concise way of working with state and lifecycle methods in functional components.

```

import React, { useState } from 'react';

const UseStateExample = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UseStateExample;
```` 



## Controlled Components

Controlled components in React have inputs and their state controlled by React. They receive their current value and the onChange handler as props, making them controlled by React and not by the DOM.

  ```
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const ControlledComponent = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setInputValue(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={inputValue}
      onChange={handleChange}
      placeholder="Type here"
    />
  );
}

export default ControlledComponent;
```

## Error Boundaries
Error boundaries are React components that detect JavaScript errors anywhere in the child component tree and log those errors, present a fallback UI or take other action.
```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    logErrorToMyService(error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <p>Something went wrong.</p>;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary;
```

## Higher Order Components

Higher Order Components (HOCs) are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional functionality. They are a way of reusing the component's logic.

```
import React from 'react';

const WithLogger = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      console.log('Component is mounted!');
    }

    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
}

export default WithLogger;

// Usage
import React from 'react';
import WithLogger from './WithLogger';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <p>My Component</p>;
}

const EnhancedComponent = WithLogger(MyComponent);
```

## Rendering Lists
React provides the `map` function to render lists of items dynamically. Each item in the array is mapped to a React element, making it easier to render dynamic content.
```
import React from 'react';

const RenderingList = () => {
  const items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'];

  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default RenderingList;
```

## Context API

The Context API in React offers a way of transmitting data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at each level. It's useful for sharing values such as themes or authentication status.
```
import React from 'react';

const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

export default ThemeContext;
```

```
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import ThemeContext from './ThemeContext';

const ThemedComponent = () => {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return <p style={{ color: theme === 'light' ? 'black' : 'white' }}>Themed Component</p>;
}

export default ThemedComponent;

```

## Keys

Keys in React help identify which items have been changed, added or removed. They should be unique within the list and help React with efficient updates.
```
import React from 'react';

const KeysExample = () => {
  const data = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' },
    { id: 3, name: 'Item 3' },
  ];

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map(item => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default KeysExample;
```

## Forms 

Handling forms in React involves managing form data using state and handling form submission via event handlers. Controlled components are used to synchronize form elements with React's state.

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const FormExample = () => {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ username: '', password: '' });

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setFormData({
      ...formData,
      [e.target.name]: e.target.value,
    });
  }

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('Form submitted:', formData);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Username:
        <input
          type="text"
          name="username"
          value={formData.username}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Password:
        <input
          type="password"
          name="password"
          value={formData.password}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default FormExample;
```

## Styling in React
Inline Styles: 
React allows you to style components using inline styles, where styles are defined as objects and applied directly to elements.

```
import React from 'react';

const InlineStyleExample = () => {
  const styles = {
    color: 'blue',
    fontSize: '18px',
  };

  return <p style={styles}>Styled with inline styles</p>;
}

export default InlineStyleExample;
 ```

## Render Props

Render Props is a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function. This allows for the dynamic composition of components.

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MouseTracker = ({ render }) => {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

  const handleMouseMove = (event) => {
    setPosition({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY });
  }

  return (
    <div style={{ height: '100vh' }} onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}>
      {render(position)}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MouseTracker;
```
```
// Usage
import React from 'react';
import MouseTracker from './MouseTracker';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <MouseTracker
      render={(position) => (
        <p>
          Mouse position: {position.x}, {position.y}
        </p>
      )}
    />
  );
}

export default App;
```

## CSS Modules

CSS Modules help define the scope of styles for a specific component, avoiding global style conflicts. Each component can have its own CSS module with locally scoped styles.

```
.myComponent {
  color: green;
}
```

```
import React from 'react';
import styles from './CSSModulesExample.module.css';

const CSSModulesExample = () => {
  return <p className={styles.myComponent}>Styled with CSS Modules</p>;
}

export default CSSModulesExample;
```

## Real World Examples
### example 1: To-Do List Application

Features:

* Adding and removing tasks
* Marking tasks as completed
* Filtering tasks (completed/incomplete)
  
 ```
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const TodoApp = () => {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);
  const [newTask, setNewTask] = useState('');

  const addTask = () => {
    setTasks([...tasks, { text: newTask, completed: false }]);
    setNewTask('');
  };

  const toggleTask = (index) => {
    const updatedTasks = [...tasks];
    updatedTasks[index].completed = !updatedTasks[index].completed;
    setTasks(updatedTasks);
  };

  const removeTask = (index) => {
    const updatedTasks = [...tasks];
    updatedTasks.splice(index, 1);
    setTasks(updatedTasks);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={newTask}
        onChange={(e) => setNewTask(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={addTask}>Add Task</button>
      <ul>
        {tasks.map((task, index) => (
          <li key={index}>
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              checked={task.completed}
              onChange={() => toggleTask(index)}
            />
            <span style={{ textDecoration: task.completed ? 'line-through' : 'none' }}>
              {task.text}
            </span>
            <button onClick={() => removeTask(index)}>Remove</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default TodoApp;
```

### Example 2: Weather App

This weather application example illustrates the practical application of React concepts, including state management, useEffect for side effects, event handling, API interaction and conditional rendering. Users can learn how to create a functional weather application and understand the integration of React hooks into real-world scenarios.

Fetaures:

Functional Component and State Hooks:

* The WeatherApp is a functional component.
* State is controlled using the `useState` hooks for `weather` and `city`.

 Using useEffect to obtain data:

* The `useEffect` hooks are used to perform side effects, such as fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
* The `fetchWeatherData` function is asynchronous and fetches weather data based on the selected city using the `fetch` API.
  
  Conditional Rendering:

* The weather data is conditionally rendered only if it exists (`weather && ...`).

Event Handling:

* The user input for the city is captured through an input element, and the `setCity` function is called on its `onChange` event.

 API Interaction:

* The OpenWeatherMap API is used to fetch real-time weather data based on the user's selected city.
* An API key is required for authentication and authorization.

 Dynamically Updating Content:

* The weather data is dynamically updated based on the selected city, and the component re-renders when the city changes.

 Styling:

* Basic styling is applied using standard HTML and inline styles for simplicity.

 Temperature Conversion:

* The temperature is converted from Kelvin to Celsius for better readability.

```
// src/RealWorldExamples/WeatherApp.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const WeatherApp = () => {
  const [weather, setWeather] = useState(null);
  const [city, setCity] = useState('New York');
  const apiKey = 'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY';

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap API
    const fetchWeatherData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(
          `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${apiKey}`
        );

        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error('Failed to fetch weather data');
        }

        const data = await response.json();
        setWeather(data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error.message);
      }
    };

    fetchWeatherData();
  }, [city, apiKey]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Weather App</h1>
      <label>
        Enter City:
        <input
          type="text"
          value={city}
          onChange={(e) => setCity(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>

      {weather && (
        <div>
          <h2>{weather.name}, {weather.sys.country}</h2>
          <p>Temperature: {Math.round(weather.main.temp - 273.15)}°C</p>
          <p>Weather: {weather.weather[0].description}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default WeatherApp;
```

  ## Best Practices


### Structuring React projects

Best practices:
* Follow folder structure conventions (for example, grouping components, styles and tests in separate folders).
* Use meaningful names for components, avoiding generic terms like "Item" or "Data".
* Organize code based on features rather than file types (for example, group components, styles and tests for a specific feature in the same folder).

  
```
/src
  /components
    /Button
      Button.js
      Button.test.js
      Button.css
  /features
    /Todo
      TodoList.js
      TodoItem.js
      TodoForm.js
  /styles
    global.css
  /tests
    /unit
      Button.test.js
    /integration
      TodoIntegration.test.js
   ```


### Performance optimization techniques:

Best practices:

* Use PureComponent or React.memo for components that are only rendered again when properties or state change.
* Implement code splitting to load only the necessary components when needed, improving initial loading times.
* Use lazy loading for components that are not immediately needed, improving application performance.
```
// Using React.memo
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  // Component logic
});

// Using Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

// In your component
const App = () => (
  <React.Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
    <MyComponent />
  </React.Suspense>
);
```

### Testing React applications:

Best practices:

* Write unit tests for individual components using test libraries such as Jest and test utilities provided by React.
* Implement integration tests to ensure that different components work together smoothly.
* Use tools such as React's test library to test user interactions and component behavior.

Example:
```
// Jest Unit Test
test('renders correctly', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<Button label="Click me" />);
  expect(getByText('Click me')).toBeInTheDocument();
});

// Jest Integration Test
test('increments count on button click', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<Counter />);
  fireEvent.click(getByText('Increment'));
  expect(getByText('Count: 1')).toBeInTheDocument();
});

// React Testing Library
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';

test('clicking button increments count', () => {
  render(<MyComponent />);
  userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'));
  expect(screen.getByText('Count: 1')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Routing e Navigation:

Best practices:

* Use React Router for client-side routing in a single-page application.
* Define routes to different views or sections of your application.
* Implement navigation components, such as `<Link>`, to allow easy navigation between routes.

  Example:
  
```
// React Router
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><Link to="/">Home</Link></li>
        <li><Link to="/about">About</Link></li>
        <li><Link to="/contact">Contact</Link></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
    <Route path="/about" component={About} />
    <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
  </Router>
);
```

### State Management:

Best practice:

* Use local component state for simple, localized state requirements.
* Use the Context API to share state between components without prop drilling.
* Consider external state management libraries, such as Redux or Recoil, for complex state management needs in larger applications.
  
```
// Using Local Component State
const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

// Using Context API
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

const ThemedComponent = () => {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <p style={{ color: theme === 'light' ? 'black' : 'white' }}>Themed Component</p>;
};

// Using Redux
// (Assuming you have a Redux store configured)
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';

const CounterRedux = () => {
  const count = useSelector(state => state.count);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Deployment

Best practices:

* Choose a hosting platform such as Netlify, Vercel or GitHub Pages to facilitate deployment.
* Set up build scripts to optimize assets for production (packaging, minification and compression).
* Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automatic deployment on code changes.
  
Example:

* Deployment platforms like Netlify and Vercel offer straightforward deployment based on your Git repository. You can connect your repository to the platform, configure build settings, and deploy with e

  
### Error Handling:

Best practices:

* Implement error thresholds to catch and handle errors gracefully, preventing the entire application from crashing.
* Record errors in a service for tracing and debugging purposes.
* Present user-friendly error messages and provide instructions on how to recover from errors, when possible.

  
Example:

```
// Error Boundary
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    logErrorToService(error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <p>Something went wrong. Please try again.</p>;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

### Accessibility (a11y):

Best practices:

* Use semantic HTML elements to provide meaningful structure to the page.
* Include ARIA functions and attributes to improve accessibility for screen readers.
* Ensure that keyboard navigation is seamless and logical for users who depend on it.

Example:

```
// Semantic HTML Elements
<article>
  <h2>Article Title</h2>
  <p>Article content...</p>
</article>

// ARIA Roles and Attributes
<button aria-label="Close" onClick={handleClose}>
  &#x2715;
</button>

// Keyboard Navigation
<input type="text" onKeyDown={handleKeyDown} />
```

### Performance Optimization:

Best practices:

* Optimize component rendering using memoization techniques (React.memo or useMemo).
* Take advantage of code splitting and slow loading to reduce the size of the initial package and improve loading times.
* Use React's PureComponent or shouldComponentUpdate to avoid unnecessary rendering.


Example:

```
// Using React.memo
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  // Component logic
});

// Using Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

// In your component
const App = () => (
  <React.Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
    <MyComponent />
  </React.Suspense>
);

// Using PureComponent
class PureCounter extends React.PureComponent {
  render() {
    return <p>Count: {this.props.count}</p>;
}
```


## Additional Topics

### Version control and updates:

* Regularly update dependencies to benefit from new features, bug fixes and security patches.
* Follow semantic versioning for libraries and packages used in the project.
* Be cautious with major updates and test thoroughly before updating.

  Example:
```
# Regularly update dependencies
npm update

# Follow semantic versioning
# Example: Major.Minor.Patch
# ^1.2.3 means any version that is compatible with 1.2.3

```

### Implementation in production:

 * Minimize the number of requests and optimize assets for faster loading times.
 * Implement server-side rendering (SSR) to improve performance and search engine optimization (SEO).
 * Use tools such as Webpack for packaging and Babel to transpile code for production.
 * 
Configure Webpack for production builds with optimizations:
```
// webpack.config.js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  mode: 'production',
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  // Other webpack configurations...
};
```


### Community resources:

* Encourage students to explore the official React documentation for detailed explanations and examples.
* Join the React community by participating in forums such as Stack Overflow, Reddit or the Reactiflux Discord community.
* Explore tutorials, blog posts and video courses from reliable sources to deepen your knowledge.
